# AI Infrastructure Handbook

Hi there! This is meant to be a resource to learn about the supercomputing infrastructure used to train and run LLMs. 

My goal is to build a comprehensive, beginner-friendly resource that helps others. I hope you find it helpful in your own journey!

This site is pretty new, so expect this site to evolve and improve over time. 


## What You'll Find Here

I'm documenting my notes on various aspects of AI infrastructure, including:

- Understanding how AI supercomputers are built and organized
- Setting up and optimizing distributed training systems
- Practical tips for improving performance
- Real examples and case studies I've found interesting
